# Git, Docker, Automated Testing, and Continuous Integration
Read below to learn how these tools improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company.

## Git
Git is the go-to version control solution for most companies, designed with performance, security, and flexibility in mind. It is ideal for development and collaboration across teams, allowing team members to each contribute to a larger project in an organized, distributed manner and ensuring that each team member is held accountable for his or her work through commit tracking. This improved development workflow impacts the success of the entire business. With a faster release cycle, marketers can increase their promotions and product managers can have more frequent customer feedback and responsive updates. Companies that use Git also provide their designers with rapid prototyping, customer support with faster bug fixes, human resources with forward-looking developers, and budget managers with more efficient (and less costly) operations. Git magnifies all business activities by ensuring that every department is doing their job more efficiently.

## Docker
Docker delivers immediate value to companies by reducing the infrastructure and maintenance costs of supporting their existing applications while accelerating the time to market for new solutions. It provides the only end-to-end (from desktop to data center) experience for developing and scaling distributed applications. In addition to building and running applications, Docker provides end-to-end security at scale as well as automated governance and compliance throughout the application lifecycle. This allows developers to quickly boost productivity by delivering apps to production faster and leveraging existing skill sets, IT operations to rapidly distribute applications globally and update apps and infrastructure on-demand with no downtime, and business leaders to deliver engaging new customer experiences and transform existing process at a rapid rate. Because Dockerâ€™s containers use shared operating systems, they are extremely efficient.
