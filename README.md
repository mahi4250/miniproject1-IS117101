## Repository
A repository is like a folder or storage space for a GIT project. A project's repository contains all of its files, such as code, documentation, images, and more. It also tracks every change that a developer (or his/her collaborators) make to each file, so the developer can always go back to previous versions of the project to fix any mistakes. In summary, a repository is a collection of commits, branches, and tags to identify commits.

## Clone
A clone is a copy of a repository that does not live on a website's server, but rather on a computer. The term can also be used as a verb to mean the act of making that copy. Clones can be useful when a developer wants to edit files in his/her preferred editor (without having to be online), but still wants to use Git to keep track of the changes. The clone is still connected to the remote version, so changes are synced between the two.
